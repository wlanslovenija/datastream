Backends
--------

API operations are implemented in backends, which are responsible for storing datapoints,
performing downsampling, deriving streams, and executing queries.

.. autoclass:: datastream.backends.mongodb.Backend
.. autoclass:: datastream.backends.influxdb.Backend

Implementation Details
......................

Streams are stored in the ``streams`` collection, datapoints are stored in the ``datapoints.<granularity>`` collections,
where ``<granularity>`` is one of the possible granularity levels.

.. todo::

    Describe the schema.
    Describe how _id value is constructed for downsampled values.

When performing downsampling, we have to differentiate between two timestamps:

* Datapoint timestamp is the timestamp of the datapoint that has been inserted for a given granularity level.
  On the highest granularity level it is always second precision. On lower granularity levels it is a dictionary
  of multiple values, depending on time downsamplers settings for a given stream.

* Internal datapoint timestamp (stored in datapoint's ``_id``) is based on a timespan for the given granularity
  level. For example, if a datapoint was inserted at 31-07-2012 12:23:52, then the downsampled internal timestamp for
  the timespan this datapoint is in for hour granularity would be 31-07-2012 12:00:00 and for month granularity would
  be 01-07-2012 00:00:00.

Based on ``highest_granularity`` value, appended datapoints are stored in the collection configured by
``highest_granularity`` and only lower granularity values are downsampled. Requests for granularity
higher than ``highest_granularity`` simply return values from ``highest_granularity`` collection.
``highest_granularity`` is just an optimization to not store unnecessary datapoints for granularity levels
which would have at most one datapoint for their granularity timespans.

.. todo::

    Describe how downsampled metadata is stored and updated by downsampling functions.
    Describe how derivation metadata is stored and used (and about derivation state).
