Datastream API documentation
============================

Datastream API is one of the projects of `wlan slovenija`_ open wireless network.
It is a Python API for time-series data which abstracts the database which is used to store the data,
providing a powerful and unified API.
It provides an easy way to insert time-series datapoints and automatically downsample them into multiple
levels of granularity for efficient querying time-series data at various time scales.

Currently supported backends are:

* MongoDB (``datastream.backends.mongodb.Backend``), which uses MongoDB/TokuMX for data and metadata
  storage.
* InfluxDB (``datastream.backends.influxdb.Backend``), which uses InfluxDB for data storage and
  PostgreSQL for metadata storage.
